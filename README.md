lightsaber_cms
==============
Haoran's new CMS. Every Jedi should build their own lightsaber, every web coder their own CMS. This is mine.

Codename: CTVTY (Hebrew for 'I write')

This is Haoran's new CMS. It's super simple. Based around a UNIX file-system,
with GIT implemented for revisioning.


Directory Structure
-------------------
Should be obvious, but maybe it isn't.
/app/		- Source files
/database/	- Repository for flat-file database (most likely SQLite)
/content/	- Contains the content for the website.
/public/	- Single access point for the app.
/vendor/	- Repository for External libraries
